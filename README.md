### There are two things provided here:
- A .applescript file - the contents of this file is what is run in the Automator Quick Action "action" step.
- A .workflow file that's installable through automator

### Making your own Quick Action (instead of installing)

You can either open the `.workflow` file in Automator and edit it from there, or create a new "Quick Action" in Automator and add the contents of the `.applescript` file to a "Run AppleScript" action. 
> ⚠️ note: make sure to select "files and folders" in the "Workflow receives current:" dropdown menu at the top of the screen.
